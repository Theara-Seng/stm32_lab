# USART Polling Concept

When we want to exchange data between two devices, we have two alternatives: we can transmit it in parallel, that is using a given number of communication lines equal to the size
of each data word. A UART/USART is a device that translates a parallel sequence of bits (usually grouped in a byte) in a continuous stream of signals flowing on a single
wire.

## USART Transimission

In a synchronous transmission, the sender and the receiver share a common clock generated by one of the two devices (usually the
device that acts as the master of this interconnection system)

we have a typical timing diagram showing the Device A sending one byte ( 0b01101001 ) serially to the Device B using a common reference clock


In a synchronous transmission the transmission speed and duration are defined by the clock: its frequency determines how fast we can transmit a single byte on the communication channel

## USART VS UART

A Universal Synchronous Receiver/Transmitter interface is a device able to transmit data word serially using two I/Os, one acting as transmitter (TX) and one as receiver (RX), plus one additional
I/O as one clock line, while a Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter uses only two RX/TX. Traditional we refer to the first interface with the term USART and to the
second one with the term UART.

## STM32 USART Configuration

In this, we will use USART2 for transmit the data from the stm32 to the computer. So, we will need a USB-TO-TTL connect from computer to the USART2 pin of the stm32
