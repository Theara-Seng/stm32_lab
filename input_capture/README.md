# Input Capture Mode (Timer)

We use input capture to measure the frequency of a device which is generated from the device.

The **Input Capture Mode** offered by general purpose and advanced timers allows to compute the frequency of external singals applied to each one of the 4 channels that these timers provide. 
And the capture is perfored indepdently for each channel.
